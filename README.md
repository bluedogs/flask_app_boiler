# flask_app_boiler
Flask boilerplate app

The purpose of this repo is to build a simple boilerplate for my apps to deploy web ideas quickly. I love Python and Flask, 

# Features
- Flask backend for API endpoints
    + Authentication endpoints and API tokens built in.
    + Just need to add custom routes for the next app.
